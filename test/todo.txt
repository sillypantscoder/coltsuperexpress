Fix spaces in names
Allow players to leave a game
Allow people to control the game (e.g. reset a game)
Player labels on the train would be nice
Add turn indicator for players on the bottom when going through a round
Allow players to select the order.

Tests to add:
- Death by shooting off the train
- Death by deleted train car
- Winning and game ending scenarios:
  - nobody lives
  - one person wins
  - one person wins due to being on the last train
  - winner walks off the end of the train (in their plan during the last round)
    - SHOULD NOT HAPPEN
  - last N people are on the last train car and all die

Bugs:
- When too many people join, the train goes off the screen. Need to autoscale or something.
- Weird behavior when not using an enormous 30" desktop monitor :-P
